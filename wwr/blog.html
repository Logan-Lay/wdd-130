                    What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down 
                    the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 
                    people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them 
                    to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, 
                    but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip. Later the temperatures 
                    soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any 
                    trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    Scorpions: They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. 
                    They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. 
                    Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief 
                    can be found with ice, aspirin and time. When in the canyon, 
                    pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear 
                    your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see 
                    where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if 
                    you get stung, see your guide immediately.

                    Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the 
                    rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep 
                    in North America. It's compact body is muscular with chocolate 
                    brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, 
                    hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators. 
                    Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also 
                    have horns, but they are short with a slight curvature. Horns 
                    are used as tools for eating and fighting. If you encounter a 
                    big horn sheep, don't agitate it. The park service asks that you 
                    stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room 
                    for escape if they feel threatened.
